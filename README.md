## Introduction to Problem Statement
 
Nearly a decade ago, I entered the world of pastry with a curious question: Why do the French have such a deep love for croissants and pastries? Is it just the sweetness and the dopamine rush that comes from eating them, or is there something more—something deeper and more meaningful that I hadn’t yet uncovered?

In my quest for answers, I found myself in the heart of a bustling kitchen, learning the craft of pastry-making from the ground up. What began as curiosity soon evolved into a deep passion, especially for the handmade creations born from love and care. Yet, of all the pastries I encountered, the croissant held my heart captive like no other. Crafting the perfect croissant is an art form—it’s not about simply following a recipe. It’s about patience, precision, physical effort, and a deep understanding of both science and artistry. A perfect croissant is more than food; it’s a masterpiece where every layer and fold whispers a story. When done right, a croissant is a symphony of texture and taste, a testament to the baker’s dedication. But a bad croissant? It’s the product of shortcuts—a reflection of indifference, devoid of soul.

Yet, I couldn’t help but notice that the croissant often goes unappreciated, brushed off by some as nothing more than a dry piece of dough. But I believe, to truly fall in love with a croissant, you have to experience the right one—the kind that inspires passion with every bite. A bad croissant will never evoke the adoration this delicate masterpiece deserves. And that got me thinking: could I change this? Could I help elevate the croissant to the status it’s worthy of? This realization sparked a fire in me, fueling a mission to spread the love for croissants far and wide.
 
Since I can't always be there to guide someone when they're choosing a croissant, I realized I needed to create something that could. Something that could always be with them, offering instant advice on whether that croissant is worth savoring. That’s when the idea for Croissant Connoisseur was born—a clever app designed to help anyone identify a high-quality croissant with just a snap. Users simply take a photo of the croissant they’re eyeing, and the app does the rest, analyzing key indicators like color, flakiness, and the number of visible layers. In seconds, it provides a recommendation, ensuring that each bite they take is well worth it, and helping people indulge with confidence.

As buyers begin to savor the finest croissants, their appreciation for this artisanal pastry will deepen, spreading the love for the craftsmanship and care that goes into creating the perfect croissant. Over time, Croissant Connoisseur won’t just help users discover great croissants—it will also foster a genuine love and respect for the art of pastry-making.
